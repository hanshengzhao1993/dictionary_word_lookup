Make a Scrabble word finder app with both a server and client.

On the client, the UI simply is a text input for your up-to-7 letters in your Scrabble rack, and a button to send the letters to the server.

On the server side, *efficiently* find words which can be made with those letters, within a big dictionary. 

Display the list of found words on the client side. 


Things I need to look up:

- Looking up how to deal with responses with Fetch on the front end
- Connecting Client and server
